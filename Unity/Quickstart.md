Quickly describe what this section will do: This section will guide you through the basic setup of the VR task. 
After you read this section, you will be able to run the task in your own lab. and you will also have a basic idea of where to start when you want to change things. 

### Technical requirements
What kind of software do you need? Talk about Unity version, VR headset, hardware requrirements?

### Download Task 
The task is publicly availble at [GitHub](https://github.com/lkumle/ObjectSorting_VR). (change this link to whatever repo it will be at the end). No idea about licenses but we might want to say something about that. Or provide a reference that we ask people to cite. 

You can clone/fork the task and make it your own!
